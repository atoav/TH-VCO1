# TH-VCO1

This is a fork based on [the Eurorack Layout Tom Whitwell]( http://www.birthofasynth.com/Thomas_Henry/Pages/VCO-1.html) Oscillator published for the [Thomas Henry VCO 1](http://www.birthofasynth.com/Thomas_Henry/Pages/VCO-1.html) Oscillator.

**NB: All rights to this design rest with Thomas Henry. I do not claim or grant any copyright or license to this design. I am not selling any boards. I will take this page down if he asks me to.** 

The only other non-standard components are a [2K 3300ppm Tempco](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/tempco-resistor-anakeohm-1-3300ppm-x3/) as R2, and a Polystyrene 1nf cap as C3.

## Changes

![](https://github.com/atoav/TH-VCO1/blob/master/Panel_Renders/VCO1-render3.jpg)

Compared to Tom's Layout some things changed:

- the complete panel layout has been changed for a fancier (and imho a bit more easier to grasp) layout
- The board-pot has been completely rerouted and is now a single layer board (the bottom layer is a nice, undivided ground plane)
- Two 1x5 Header Pin Strips have been added (this could potentially help to save the screws and add mechanical stability)
- All Resistor Pads have been swapped for square pads
- The PWM CV Attenuator Pot is now a 9mm Alpha trimmer (the small ones with the plastic head, commonly used for attenuverters)
- Cleaned up traces and silkscreen where necessary
